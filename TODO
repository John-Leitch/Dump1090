TODO

* Extract more information from captured Mode S messages.
* Improve the web interface gmap.html.
* Enhance the algorithm to reliably decode more messages.
* On the Web-page:
  - show the distance to the selected plane
    (based on an exact position of the RTLSDR; use a cookie to store it?).
  - show debug info and parsed messages. Use EmScripten to push it?
